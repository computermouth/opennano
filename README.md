opennano
===

opennano is a tiny nano clone without any library dependencies.

The goal of the project is to implement the most important parts of nano while staying under 1024 lines of code (as counted by `cloc`).

Usage:

    opennano <filename>

Keys:

    ctrl-k = Cut/kill line
    ctrl-w = Search
    ctrl-u = UnCut line
    ctrl-? = Help
    ctrl-o = Save
    ctrl-x = Exit

Syntax highlighting support:

* Sash (`*.sh`)

opennano is based on openemacs which is based on Kilo - a minimal editor written by Salvatore Sanfilippo (antirez).

The code is released under the 2-clause BSD license.
